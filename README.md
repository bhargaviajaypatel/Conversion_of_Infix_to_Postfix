# Conversion_of_Infix_to_Postfix
As our computer system canonly understand and work on a binary language, it assumes that an arthmetic operation can take place in two operands only e.g.,(A+B)*C(D/(J+D)).
These complex arthmetic operations can be executed in two operands and an operator form.

Infix Expression:- It follows the scheme of <operand><operator><operand>i.e. an <operand>is preceded and succeded by an <operand> such an expression is termed infix expression. E.g. :- A+B
  
Postfix Expression :- It follows the scheme of <operand><operand><operator> i.e. an <operator> is succeded by both the <operand>. E.g. :- AB+
